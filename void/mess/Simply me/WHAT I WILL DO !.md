Today is Tuesday Dec 5 2023, and this is a detailed note of i will proceed to make changes in my life, changes that require a huge effort and a very profound will. It won't be easy but i will do it anyways, with god's help, family's love and of course with getting up everyday going towards my goals and plans. 

Time is a very important variable in this situation, time flies, really ! But i believe with working hard and focusing more i will achieve more with spending more time learning. 

Learn even if i am tired and a little bit sleepy, sacrifice my own comfort and study more to accomplish what i want. 

Starting with my university's courses then adding few more other skills to learn along the way, these skills like : 
- React.
- LaTex.
- Git.
- DSA with javascript.

University courses : 
- Discrete mathematics.
- Linear algebra.
- Java & OOP.
- Chinese.

So i will excel at Java & OOP, React, LaTeX, Git and DSA with javascript. 


> [!NOTE] One important note
> Following courses from udemy, books and other pirated courses from tutflix, it will be much more fun to follow these contents and learn the maximum from it. 
>  > So the plan is to follow these resources and then learn whatever comes in the way, learning is my habit and i will recover from any past trauma, focusing only on my studies and spend time learning what i love, i should be patient because it will take some time to see some outcome but the most important thing is that i have to study everyday and every hour when i am out of class, it is more than enough to excel at these things i want to learn ! 
>  > > Planning my days will the greatest thing to proceed efficiently in what i love to do.

Today is Sat Dec 16, 2023. I have a small update, yet with a huge impact on my perspective, idgf about what is happening around me, no one will ever put me off track. I will sacrifice my sleep and my comfort just to learn what i want. I shall always pray and worship god  because god is the only one that gets me and knows me better than anyone.
