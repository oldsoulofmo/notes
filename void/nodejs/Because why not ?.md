Learning nodejs because I want to be a full stack developer. 

emphasizing on what I have learnt in javascript years earlier, node is designed to be synchronous _(blocking execution on each line)_ so to solve this solution we have asynchronous _(non-blocking)_ code using callback functions that will not block execution and will actually be executed once data arrives. 

nodejs is single threaded meaning that  the app's code will run on one thread only, the thread is in the cpu.
