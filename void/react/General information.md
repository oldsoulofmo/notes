To know if a project was created using CRA[^1] or CVA[^2] we can check the the `package.json` file : 

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
```

All of them starting with `react-scripts` means they were created using CRA.
