-  I might have the makeup exam on 20ish something and this is my plan. 
- Each day memorize a set of questions (20 to 25) per set.
	 It will take 3 to 4 days.
- After memorizing the mcq  I must start learning the calculations part.
	 It won't take more than a day to study all of them.
- Lastly, I must answer previous old exam. 
	 Answering the old exam and reviewing the notes I will make until the day of the exam arrives.
