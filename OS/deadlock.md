**1. What is a deadlock?**  
**Answer:** A situation where two or more processes are waiting for each other to release resources.

**2. Which of the following conditions must hold for a deadlock to occur?**  
**Answer:** Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait.

**3. What is the primary method for dealing with deadlocks?**  
**Answer:** Preventing deadlocks from occurring.

**4. What is the purpose of the Banker's algorithm?**  
**Answer:** To prevent deadlocks by ensuring the system is always in a safe state.

**5. Which of the following is a necessary condition for deadlock to occur?**  
**Answer:** Mutual exclusion.

**6. Which of the following is true about resource preemption?**  
**Answer:** It can resolve a deadlock by forcibly taking resources from one process and giving them to another.

**7. What does the term "circular wait" refer to in relation to deadlocks?**  
**Answer:** Each process holds one resource and requests another that is held by another process in a circular chain.

**8. Which technique can be used to prevent deadlocks?**  
**Answer:** Deadlock avoidance.

**9. What is the purpose of resource preemption?**  
**Answer:** To detect and recover from deadlocks.

**10. Which of the following is a drawback of deadlock avoidance?**  
**Answer:** It can result in reduced resource utilization.

**11. What does the Banker's algorithm do?**  
**Answer:** Determines if a system is in a safe state.

**12. Which of the following is NOT an example of a resource in the context of deadlocks?**  
**Answer:** Process.

**13. Which technique aims to avoid circular wait in resource allocation?**  
**Answer:** Resource allocation graph.

**14. Which solution provides both deadlock prevention and avoidance?**  
**Answer:** Banker's algorithm.

**15. Which statement about deadlock prevention is true?**  
**Answer:** It avoids circular wait by imposing a specific order for resource allocation.

**16. Which deadlock avoidance algorithm requires knowledge of the maximum resource needs of each process?**  
**Answer:** Banker's algorithm.

**17. What is the purpose of the "safe state" in the context of deadlocks?**  
**Answer:** It guarantees that no deadlock will ever occur.

**18. What is an example of a method to detect deadlocks?**  
**Answer:** Resource allocation graphs.

**19. What is the purpose of the deadlock detection algorithm in operating systems?**  
**Answer:** To detect deadlocks and take corrective actions.

**20. What is the significance of the Safety Algorithm in the Banker's Algorithm?**  
**Answer:** It checks if a system state is safe before allocating resources.
