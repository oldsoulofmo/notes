#### Calculation 

The FCB length of a file is 64 bytes and the disk block size is 1KB, there can be a maximum of 640 files in a directory, how many disk blocks are needed to store all the files FCB in a directory , and how many times does it take to get the address of a file on the hard drive on average?


ANSWER : 

1. Number of Disk Blocks Needed:

   Given:
   - FCB length = 64 bytes
   - Disk block size = 1 KB (1024 bytes)
   - Maximum files per directory = 640 files

   Each FCB is 64 bytes. To calculate how many FCBs fit in one disk block:
   FCBs per block = 1024 bytes / 64 bytes = 16 FCBs per block

   So, the number of disk blocks needed to store 640 FCBs:
   Blocks needed = 640 FCBs / 16 FCBs/block = 40 blocks

2. Average Number of Accesses to Get File Address:

   Since the directory can hold a maximum of 640 files, and assuming each file is stored in a sequential manner with direct access:
   - On average, half of the FCBs would need to be checked to find the address of a file.
   - Therefore, the average number of accesses is:
   Average accesses = 640 / 2 = 320 accesses

Final Answers:
- Disk blocks needed: 40 blocks
- Average accesses: 320 accesses
