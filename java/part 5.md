```java
Person joan = new Person("Joan Ball");
System.out.println(joan);

Person ball = joan;
ball.growOlder();
ball.growOlder();

System.out.println(joan);

joan = new Person("Joan B.");
System.out.println(joan);
```

The ball project here is still `{joan ball, 2}` and after the last line the ball object is the only one pointing to that object while joan now is pointing at `{Joan B. , 0}`



This is about returning an object from a method.

```java
public class Counter {
    private int value;

    // example of using multiple constructors:
    // you can call another constructor from a constructor by calling this
    // notice that the this call must be on the first line of the constructor
    public Counter() {
        this(0);
    }

    public Counter(int initialValue) {
        this.value = initialValue;
    }

    public void increase() {
        this.value = this.value + 1;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "value: " + value;
    }

    public Counter clone() {
        // create a new counter object that receives the value of the cloned counter as its initial value
        Counter clone = new Counter(this.value);

        // return the clone to the caller
        return clone;
    }
}
```
